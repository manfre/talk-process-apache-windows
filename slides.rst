Why Windows?
------------

- Windows shop

  - IT knowledge

- Legacy Business Database on MS SQL

  - Triggers, user funcs, stored procs, SSIS, SSRS
  - Replication not an option 
    (tech limitations and historical business reasons)

- Didn't have a choice

Why Not IIS, ASP.NET, PHP, etc?
-------------------------------

- Contact me after the talk

----

Windows MPM Options
-------------------

- mpm_winnt
  
  - One process, many threads

----

What's Wrong With Threads?
--------------------------

- Uses more resources
- Most pages have lots of IO

  - Network (Request/Response)
  - Cache
  - Database
  - Disk (Templates)

- "Understanding the GIL" - David Beazley `http://www.dabeaz.com/GIL/`_

  - Threads release their lock when blocking for IO

  Dear SRC, 
    Congratulations on launching your new site. Sorry it buckled under non-peak load.
  Sincerely,
    Global Interpreter Lock


----

How We Worked Around It?
------------------------

- Web farm on a box
- Load balancer

  - mod_proxy_balancer (on the box)
  - HAProxy

----

It's Not All Bad
----------------

  "What is life without challenges?" - Richard Castle


- More fault tolerant
- Ready to scale

Is There A Better Way?
